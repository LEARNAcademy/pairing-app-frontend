# Pairing App Frontend
As developers, we're always on the lookout for tools that can make our work easier. And if we can't find those tools, we create them ourselves! That's exactly how this pairing randomizer application started. Although this application is still in development, the goal of this app is to make life easier for instructors by helping them organize and manage their classrooms effortlessly. It takes care of maintaining and optimizing pairs, so instructors can focus on what they do best!

## Wireframe
Planning is an important step in the process of development. This application has many pieces to create a cohesive application. One of the most important pieces is to have a structured design to streamline development. You can find the Figma wireframe [here](https://www.figma.com/file/F5acwOsQiA7CEd9S6PrzQW/Pairing-Randomizer?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=BAEZG77mV7rjNFDq-1)

## Structure
The frontend consists of a standard React application. Inside the root directory contains the src folder where you can find assets, components, and pages. These folders are where the magic happens along with App.js that is the nerve center of it all.

## Run Locally
To get this app up and running on your computer, follow the below steps:
- clone application
- `cd pairing-app-frontend`
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

** Please note that this is only the frontend application to a decoupled full stack application. You will also need the [pairing-app-backend repo](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/pairing-app-backend)
